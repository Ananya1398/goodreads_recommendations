"""
Data Normalization Module for Goodreads Recommendation System

This module applies normalization transformations to the features table to prepare
data for machine learning model training. It performs log transformations on
skewed features and user-centered rating normalization.

Key Transformations:
- Log transformation for skewed numeric features (popularity, activity counts, etc.)
- User-centered rating normalization to remove individual rating biases
- Handles edge cases for zero and negative values
