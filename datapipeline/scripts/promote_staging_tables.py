Staging Table Promotion Module for Goodreads Data Pipeline

This module handles the promotion of staging tables to production by replacing
the production tables with the cleaned and processed staging data. It ensures
a clean transition from staging to production environment.

Key Features:
- Promotes staging tables to production tables
- Replaces existing production tables with staging data
- Cleans up staging tables after successful promotion
- Provides logging for promotion operations
